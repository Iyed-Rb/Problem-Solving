# LeetCode 50 SQL Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the first **50 SQL problems** on LeetCode, listed in order from problem **1 to 50**.

For each problem, I include **one or more possible solutions** to demonstrate different approaches (e.g., using `JOIN`, subqueries, `CTE`s, etc.).

## Notes

- Problems are organized by their number on LeetCode (1â€“50).  
- I explore alternative solutions where possible, not just the most common one.  
- The goal is to **strengthen SQL skills** by practicing a variety of techniques.
